A doubly-linked list is a data structure that consists of sequentially linked nodes, and the nodes have reference to both the previous and the next nodes in the sequence of nodes.

You’re given a doubly-linked list and a key 'k'.

Delete all the nodes having data equal to ‘k’.

Example:
Input: Linked List: 10 <-> 4 <-> 10 <-> 3 <-> 5 <-> 20 <-> 10 and ‘k’ = 10

Output: Modified Linked List: 4 <-> 3 <-> 5 <-> 20

Explanation: All the nodes having ‘data’ = 10 are removed from the linked list.
